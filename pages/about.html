        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>

        <h2>An Unexpected Beginning</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Doca, a 19-year-old self-taught programmer and designer from Switzerland, living in the French-speaking part. My journey into the digital world began in 2010 when I was just 6 years old. My cousin introduced me to the internet by sitting me down in front of his computer, where I discovered Minecraft. This sparked my fascination with programming, and I began creating small mods for the game.</p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>Combining my love for design and programming was a natural choice for me. Although I haven't attended a formal development school yet, I've been diligently working on my own projects, constantly learning and improving my skills. I take my work seriously and believe in the joy of learning through doing.</p>

        <h2>My Values</h2>
        <p>I firmly believe in the power of passion-driven learning. For me, programming isn't just a job; it's a craft that I enjoy mastering. I value dedication, creativity, and continuous growth.</p>


        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me enjoying sports, watching movies, or having a good time at a barbecue with friends. These activities keep me balanced and energized, bringing a fresh perspective to my work.</p>
